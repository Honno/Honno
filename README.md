I'm currently developing [**coinflip**](https://github.com/Honno/coinflip), a randomness testing suite made in Python. It started as my undergrad thesis project, with my final report available as [ðŸ“œ PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Honno/coinflip/report/report.pdf), and my presentation available on [â–¶ YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xrWG3Ki9Z8).

You might know me for my [writing on recursive gzip bombs](https://blog.matthewbarber.io/2019/07/22/how-to-make-compressed-file-quines), where we made âš  [quine.gz](https://blog.matthewbarber.io/downloads/quine.gz) âš  together. I'm particularly proud of how I teach compression-algorithm-tomfoolery with fun and descriptive ASCII charts. My recursive compressed file is used in testing Apache's [Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) project, and is currently [wreaking havoc](https://twitter.com/_tallison/status/1245100964111159298) on modern Mac systems ðŸ˜ˆ

I'm looking for a graduate role, UK or abroadâ€”pop me an [email](mailto:quitesimplymatt@gmail.com) if you're interested in hiring me! My rÃ©sumÃ© is available [here](https://matthewbarber.io/assets/home/matthew-barber-cv-online.pdf) :)
